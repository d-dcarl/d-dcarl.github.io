# Portfolio Images

This directory is for storing all images used in the portfolio.

## Recommended Images to Add:

1. **Your professional headshot/photo** - Approximately 500x500px
2. **Project screenshots** - At least 1200px wide for good quality
3. **Game design documents** - Shows your design process
4. **Concept art** - If you have any sketches or concept art to showcase
5. **Logo** - If you have a personal brand logo

## Image Optimization

Before adding images to your portfolio, make sure they are:
- Optimized for web (reduced file size without losing quality)
- In the appropriate format (.jpg for photos, .png for graphics with transparency)
- Properly named with descriptive filenames (e.g., dungeon-crawler-gameplay.jpg)
